40K 10th Edition Dice Roller

Coded entirely in Python and then compiled with PyInstaller as one directory.
Made to calculate averages for dice rolls giving the best probability for certain unit matchups.

How to:
#: = Total Number of Models in Attacking Unit
A: = Number of Attacks by Attacking model
BS: = Ballistic Skill (Can also be Weapon Skill)
S: = Strength
AP: = Armor Pen
D: = Damage
T: = Toughness of Defending Model
Sv: = Armor Save of Defending Model
W: = Wounds of Defending Model
(Optional)
Invuln: = Invulnerable Save of defending Unit, if None, leave 0
FNP: = Feel No Pain of defending Unit, if None, leave 0

After entering the aforementioned numbers, check any modifiers that the Attacking/Defending Unit may have.
Click Avg.? then Roll Dice.

The roller operates in two different modes, Average will give you a statistical average of 100,000 rolls, and the probability of getting X+ units destroyed.
When (Avg?) is unchecked, you will get Roll mode, which will simulate a single roll as if you were playing the game.
