40K 10th Edition Dice Roller

Coded entirely in Python and then compiled with PyInstaller as one directory.
Made to calculate averages for dice rolls giving the best probability for certain unit matchups.

Fill in the relevant stats from a Unit's datasheet, click Average, and then roll.
The roller operates in two different modes, Average will give you a statistical average of 10,000 rolls, and the probability of getting X+ units destroyed.
When (Avg?) is unchecked, you will get Roll mode, which will simulate a single roll as if you were playing the game.
